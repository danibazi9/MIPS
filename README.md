# MIPS
**The implementation & virtualization of the MIPS computer architecture**

"Computer-Aided Design" course project, IUST, Dr. Fazeli, Spring 2021

We've implemented 32-bit **pipelined MIPS architecture** by the `Verilog` hardware programming language. We've also virtualize 8-bit MIPS using `Proteus` with full functionality. All of the units include PC, Memory, Register File, ALU & other decoders do their work successfully. 

We use this schema as the base architecture:

**Notes:**
+ There are several Verilog files in this project with the format `.v`. To run the whole project, you need to open the whole folder in some special softwares such as `Xilinx`.
+ The virtualization files are in the folder `Virtualization`. You need to open these files with `Proteus` software.
